Name: anna/choose_modules_lowmem
Type: multiselect
Choices: ${CHOICES}
Description: Installer components to load:
Extended_description: To save memory, only components that are certainly needed for an install are selected by default. The other installer components are not all necessary for a basic install, but you may need some of them, especially certain kernel modules, so look through the list carefully and select the components you need.\n\nNote that if you select a component that requires others, those components will also be loaded.

Type: boolean
Default: false
Description: Continue the install without loading kernel modules?
Extended_description: No kernel modules were found. This probably is due to a mismatch between the kernel used by this version of the installer and the kernel version available in the archive.\n\nIf you're installing from a mirror, you can work around this problem by choosing to install a different version of Ubuntu. The install will probably fail to work if you continue without kernel modules.

It only supports the Latin and the\n   Cyrillic scripts.\n\nIf you prefer bold version of the Terminus font and you don't use framebuffer then choose TerminusBoldVGA.  If you use framebuffer then choose TerminusBold.

Name: console-setup/fontsize

Description: Font size:
Extended_description: Please select the size of the font for the Linux console.  When the size is represented as a plain number then the corresponding font can be used with all console drivers and the number measures the height of the symbols (in number of scan lines).  Otherwise the size has the format HEIGHTxWIDTH and the corresponding fonts can be used only if you use framebuffer and the kbd console package (console-tools doesn't work for such fonts).  Currently these fonts can not be used if the framebuffer you use is based on the RadeonFB kernel module.\n\nYou can use the height of the fonts in order to figure out the real size of the symbols on the console.  For a reference - the font your computer starts with has height 16.

Name: console-setup/fontsize-text

Description: Method for temporarily toggle between national and Latin input:
Extended_description: Sometimes the keyboard is in national mode and you want to type only few Latin letters. In this case it may be desirable to have a key for temporary switching between national and Latin symbols.  While this key is pressed in national mode the keyboard types Latin letters and in reverse, when the keyboard is in Latin mode and you are pressing this key the keyboard will type national letters.\n\nIf you don't like this feature, choose the option "No temporary switch".

Name: console-setup/toggle
Type: select
Default: Alt+Shift
Choices: Caps Lock, Right Alt, Right Control, Right Shift, Right Logo key, Menu key, Alt+Shift, Control+Shift, Shift+Caps Lock, Control+Alt, Both Shift keys together, Both Control keys together, Both Alt keys together, Left Alt, Left Control, Left Shift, Left Logo key, No toggling
Description: Method for toggling between national and Latin mode:
Extended_description: You will need a way to toggle the keyboard between the national layout and the standard Latin layout.  Several options are available.\n\nThe most ergonomic choices seem to be the right Alt and the Caps Lock keys (in the later case use the combination Shift+Caps Lock for normal Caps toggle).  Another popular choice is the Alt+Shift combination; notice however that in this case the combination Alt+Shift (or Control+Shift if you choose it) will lose its usual meaning in Emacs and other programs using it.\n\nNotice the listed keys are not present on all keyboards.

Extended_description: The grub package failed to install into /target/.  Installing GRUB as a boot loader is a required step.  The install problem might however be unrelated to GRUB, so continuing the installation may be possible.

Name: grub-installer/bootdev
Type: string
Description: Device for boot loader installation:
Extended_description: You need to make the newly installed system bootable, by installing the GRUB boot loader on a bootable device. The usual way to do this is to install GRUB on the master boot record of your first hard drive. If you prefer, you can install GRUB elsewhere on the drive, or to another drive, or even to a floppy.\n\nThe device can be specified using GRUB's "(hdn,m)" notation, or as a device in /dev. Below are some examples:\n - "(hd0)" or "/dev/hda" will install GRUB to the master boot record\n   of your first hard drive (IDE);\n - "(hd0,1)" or "/dev/hda2" will use the second partition of your\n   first IDE drive;\n - "(hd2,4)" or "/dev/sdc5" will use the first extended partition of\n   your third drive (SCSI here);\n - "(fd0)" or "/dev/fd0" will install GRUB to a floppy.\n\n

Extended_description: GRUB 2 is the next generation of GNU GRUB. It has interesting new features but is still experimental software. If you choose to install it, you should be prepared for breakage, and have an idea on how to recover your system if it becomes unbootable. You're advised not to try this in production environments.

Name: grub-installer/install_to_xfs
Type: boolean
Default: false
Description: Install the GRUB boot loader to XFS file system?
Extended_description: The GRUB boot loader installation often fails or hangs when /boot is on a XFS file system. Using LILO in this situation is recommended.

Name: grub-installer/only_debian
Type: boolean
Default: true
Description: Install the GRUB boot loader to the master boot record?
Extended_description: It seems that this new installation is the only operating system on this computer. If so, it should be safe to install the GRUB boot loader to the master boot record of your first hard drive.\n\nWarning: If the installer failed to detect another operating system that is present on your computer, modifying the master boot record will make that operating system temporarily unbootable, though GRUB can be manually configured later to boot it.

Name: grub-installer/password
Type: password
Description: GRUB password:
Extended_description: The GRUB boot loader offers many powerful interactive features, which could be used to compromise your system if unauthorized users have access to the machine when it is starting up. To defend against this, you may choose a password which will be required before editing menu entries or entering the GRUB command-line interface. By default, any user will still be able to start any menu entry without entering the password.\n\nIf you do not wish to set a GRUB password, leave this field blank.

When the boot loader is installed in a partition, you must set the bootable flag for it. Such a partition will be marked with "${BOOTABLE}" in the main partitioning menu.

Type: text
Description: In order to start your new system, the firmware on your Itanium system loads the boot loader from its private EFI partition on the hard disk.  The boot loader then loads the operating system from that same partition.  An EFI partition has a FAT16 file system formatted on it and the bootable flag set. Most installations place the EFI partition on the first primary partition of the same hard disk that holds the root file system.

Extended_description: Partitioning a hard drive consists of dividing it to create the space needed to install your new system.  You need to choose which partition(s) will be used for the installation.\n\nSelect a free space to create partitions in it.\n\nSelect a device to remove all partitions in it and create a new empty partition table.\n\nSelect a partition to remove it or to specify how it should be used. At a bare minimum, you need one partition to contain the root of the file system (whose mount point is /).  Most people also feel that a separate swap partition is a necessity.  "Swap" is scratch space for an operating system, which allows the system to use disk storage as "virtual memory".\n\nWhen the partition is already formatted you may choose to keep and use the existing data in the partition.  Partitions that will be used in this way are marked with "${KEEP}" in the main partitioning menu.\n\nIn general you will want to format the partition with a newly created file system.  NOTE: all data in the partition will be irreversibly deleted.  If you decide to format a partition that is already formatted, it will be marked with "${DESTROY}" in the main partitioning menu.  Otherwise it will be marked with "${FORMAT}".\n\n${ARCHITECTURE_HELP}

A malicious or unqualified user with root access can have disastrous results, so you should take care to choose a root password that is not easy to guess. It should not be a word found in dictionaries, or a word that could be easily associated with you.\n\nA good password will contain a mixture of letters, numbers and punctuation and should be changed at regular intervals.\n\nNote that you will not be able to see the password as you type it.
